# 🔮 **FOR FUTURE REFERENCE: Client Agent Architecture**

**Status**: DOCUMENTED FOR POST-DAY 3 IMPLEMENTATION  
**Priority**: Focus on Day 3 launch first, then revisit this architecture  
**Created**: August 18, 2025

## 📋 **QUICK REFERENCE**

- **Vision Document**: `PM33-CLIENT-AGENT-ARCHITECTURE-VISION.md`
- **Current System**: `pm33-orchestration/` (4 core agents operational)
- **Architecture Recommendation**: Hub & Spoke topology
- **Implementation Timeline**: Post-Day 3 validation

## 🎯 **KEY CONCEPTS TO REMEMBER**

### **Client Agent Types Identified:**
- **WorkItemSyncAgent** - PM tool data ingestion & sync
- **ClientDataIntelligenceAgent** - Analytics from client data
- **ClientStrategyAgent** - Client-specific strategic analysis  
- **ClientOptimizationAgent** - Continuous improvement
- **ClientRelationshipAgent** - Communication & satisfaction

### **Multi-Tenant Architecture:**
- Client context isolation in `client_contexts/`
- Customization tiers (Standard → Enterprise → White Label)
- Privacy levels (Public → Classified)

### **Revenue Implications:**
- Premium tiers based on agent complexity
- Agent marketplace potential
- Custom agent development services

## 🚀 **WHEN TO REVISIT**

**Triggers to implement client agent architecture:**
1. ✅ Day 3 launch completed successfully
2. ✅ Core PM33 product-market fit validated
3. ✅ 3+ enterprise clients requesting customization
4. ✅ Revenue target on track ($25K+ MRR)
5. ✅ Technical infrastructure stable

**Next steps when triggers hit:**
1. Review this document and full vision
2. Start with WorkItemSyncAgent prototype
3. Build client context isolation framework
4. Begin beta testing with willing clients
