# CLAUDE CODE - MANDATORY READING
# YOU MUST READ THIS BEFORE WRITING ANY CODE

## ðŸš¨ STOP - DO NOT WRITE CODE YET

1. Read `UI_IMPLEMENTATION_RULES.md` completely
2. Read `components/core/COPY_EXACTLY.tsx` completely  
3. ONLY copy code from approved component files
4. NEVER create your own UI implementations
5. Run `npm run validate:ui` before EVERY commit

## YOUR ONLY JOB:
Copy the exact components from `components/core/` folder.
Do NOT be creative. Do NOT simplify. COPY EXACTLY.
