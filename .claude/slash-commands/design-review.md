description: Conduct a comprehensive PM33 design review using Playwright MCP for live UI testing, brand compliance, and strategic workflow validation
---

I'll conduct a comprehensive design review of the PM33 interface focusing on strategic intelligence platform requirements, brand compliance, and user experience for Product Managers.

## PM33 Design Review Process

### Phase 1: Environment Setup & Brand Assessment
Let me start by navigating to the PM33 application and assessing the current state:

**Testing PM33 Homepage and Core Strategic Workflows**

I'll systematically evaluate:
1. **PM33 Brand Compliance** - Logo, Mantine UI usage, professional aesthetics
2. **Strategic Intelligence Workflows** - Homepage, Strategic Intelligence Engine, Command Center
3. **Enterprise-Grade Appearance** - Card-based layouts, visual hierarchy, 8pt grid system
4. **PM Workflow Efficiency** - User flows for strategic decision-making
5. **Responsive Design** - Desktop (1440px), tablet (768px), mobile (375px)
6. **Accessibility Standards** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
7. **Design System Consistency** - Mantine components, color palette, typography

### Key Focus Areas for PM33:

**Strategic Intelligence Platform Requirements:**
- Professional appearance that eliminates "laundry list" formatting
- Clear information hierarchy for strategic decision-making
- Progressive disclosure patterns for complex strategic analysis
- Efficient workflows for PM productivity (10x smarter positioning)

**PM33-Specific Standards:**
- Mantine UI framework compliance (not Tailwind)
- PM33 logo integration throughout interface
- Enterprise-grade visual design for Series A-C startup PMs
- Strategic intelligence terminology and workflow optimization

Let me begin the comprehensive review...
