# PM33 Multi-Agent Orchestration System

## Overview
Sophisticated multi-agent coordination system for PM33 PMO transformation platform development. Provides specialized agents with relevant context, scope optimization, and human oversight.

## Agent Specialization

### Technical Agent (Full Autonomy)
**Context**: Proven patterns, data architecture, UX specs, demo requirements only
**Authority**: API development, database schema, components, performance, integrations
**Escalates**: Value prop UI changes, major architecture affecting other agents, budget decisions

### Strategy Agent (Escalates Major Decisions)  
**Context**: Strategic docs, competitive intelligence, execution context only
**Authority**: Competitive analysis, framework recommendations, risk assessment
**Escalates**: Value proposition changes, positioning shifts, strategic priorities

### GTM Agent (Escalates Strategy)
**Context**: Marketing materials, strategic messaging, competitive context only  
**Authority**: Content creation, email sequences, community engagement
**Escalates**: Complete GTM strategy, pricing, brand positioning, target market

### UX Agent (Escalates Conversions)
**Context**: UX architecture, demo design, strategic context, technical constraints only
**Authority**: Component styling, layouts, accessibility, mobile design
**Escalates**: Conversion flows, Strategic Command Center, navigation, gamification

## Key Features

### 1. Relevant Context Only
Each agent loads only the files relevant to their role (not everything), reducing context overhead while maintaining decision quality.

### 2. Scope Optimization
Agents analyze their performance and suggest authority expansions:
- **Authority expansion requests** with justification & risk assessment
- **Cross-agent collaboration** opportunities identification  
- **Efficiency bottlenecks** analysis and solutions
- **Performance data** tracking for optimization

### 3. Conflict Resolution
Automated conflict resolution with PM33-specific rules:
- **Technical vs UX**: UX wins on user experience, Technical on feasibility
- **Strategy vs GTM**: Strategy wins on positioning, GTM on tactics
- **Timeline conflicts**: Day 3 requirements take priority
- **Resource conflicts**: Immediate escalation to human

### 4. Human Decision Interface
- **Daily briefings** with urgent decisions, progress, and agent status
- **Scope review process** for agent authority optimization
- **Structured escalations** with impact analysis and recommendations
- **Decision processing** with automatic agent notification

## Usage

### Start Orchestration
```bash
cd pm33-orchestration
python3 master_orchestrator.py
```

### Daily Briefing
The system generates daily briefings with:
- Urgent decisions requiring human input
- Day 3 launch progress and timeline risk
- Agent progress and pending items
- Agentic AI teams development status
- Scope optimization opportunities

### Human Decision Input
Create `human_decisions.json`:
```json
{
  "decisions": [
    {
      "id": "scope_001", 
      "type": "scope_change",
      "agent": "technical",
      "approval": "approve",
      "scope_changes": {
        "new_autonomous_decisions": ["database_schema_full_authority"],
        "remove_escalations": ["component_props_interface_decisions"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Process Decisions
```bash
python3 human_interface/daily_briefing.py
```

## PM33-Specific Integration

### Strategic Context
- **Mission**: Transform PMs into PMOs through agentic AI teams
- **Value Prop**: Product-led growth via strategic automation
- **Target**: $100K MRR by Dec 31, 2025
- **Phase**: Day 3 beta launch preparation

### Agentic AI Teams Status Tracking
- **Strategic AI**: Multi-framework analysis capability
- **Workflow AI**: Task generation and PM tool integration  
- **Data AI**: Company context learning and predictive analytics
- **Comms AI**: Stakeholder management and executive reporting

### Proven Pattern Integration
Leverages successful patterns from Replit solution while avoiding failed approaches (OAuth, incomplete UX workflows).

## Benefits

1. **Parallel Development**: 4 agents working simultaneously on different aspects
2. **Strategic Control**: Human oversight for all positioning/messaging decisions  
3. **Quality Assurance**: Conflict tracking prevents inconsistencies
4. **Continuous Optimization**: Agents suggest scope improvements based on performance
5. **Context Efficiency**: Agents only load relevant context, reducing overhead
6. **Progress Visibility**: Real-time tracking of Day 3 launch requirements

## Next Steps

1. **Launch agents** for immediate parallel development
2. **Review daily briefings** for decision needs and progress
3. **Optimize agent scopes** based on performance suggestions  
4. **Monitor Day 3 timeline** through automated progress tracking

The orchestration system accelerates PM33 development while maintaining strategic alignment and quality control.
