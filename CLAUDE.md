# PM33 Claude Code Memory File

## üéØ **Corrected Project Vision & Mission**

**PM33: PMO Transformation Platform** - Transforms individual Product Managers into fully functional PMOs through agentic AI teams.

**Core Problem Solved**: PMs need PMO-level strategic capabilities but lack team, budget, and infrastructure. PM33 provides agentic AI teams that deliver PMO functionality.

**Target**: $100K MRR by EOY 2025 through PMO transformation services (NOT $300K - user corrected this)

**Critical Vision Correction**: 
- ‚ùå OLD: "Ultimate Product Agent", "$300K MRR", consultant replacement
- ‚úÖ NEW: "PMO Transformation Platform", "$100K MRR", PMO capabilities for individual PMs
