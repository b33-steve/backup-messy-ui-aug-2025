# PM33 Claude Code Memory File

## üéØ **Corrected Project Vision & Mission**

**PM33: PMO Transformation Platform** - Transforms individual Product Managers into fully functional PMOs through agentic AI teams.

**Core Problem Solved**: PMs need PMO-level strategic capabilities but lack team, budget, and infrastructure. PM33 provides agentic AI teams that deliver PMO functionality.

**Target**: $100K MRR by EOY 2025 through PMO transformation services (NOT $300K - user corrected this)

**Critical Vision Correction**: 
- ‚ùå OLD: "Ultimate Product Agent", "$300K MRR", consultant replacement
- ‚úÖ NEW: "PMO Transformation Platform", "$100K MRR", PMO capabilities for individual PMs

## üöÄ **4 Agentic AI Teams Architecture**

### **1. Strategic Intelligence AI Team**
- **Lead AI**: Anthropic Claude (complex strategic reasoning)
- **Services**: Claude + Pinecone + PostHog
- **Role**: Multi-framework strategic analysis (ICE/RICE/Porter's Five Forces), competitive intelligence
- **Output**: Strategic recommendations, competitive response strategies

### **2. Workflow Execution AI Team**
- **Lead AI**: OpenAI (structured outputs, task automation)
- **Services**: OpenAI + Railway + PM Tool APIs
- **Role**: Automated task creation, cross-functional coordination, PM tool integration

### **3. Data Intelligence AI Team**
- **Lead AI**: Together AI (cost-effective bulk processing)
- **Services**: Together AI + Pinecone + Railway
- **Role**: Company-specific context learning, historical pattern recognition, predictive analytics
- **Output**: Performance optimization, trend analysis, data-driven insights

### **4. Communication AI Team**
- **Lead AI**: Claude/OpenAI (communication quality)
- **Services**: Claude/OpenAI + Resend + Railway
- **Role**: Stakeholder communication, executive summaries, cross-team alignment
- **Output**: Professional communications, strategic presentations, alignment facilitation

## üèóÔ∏è **Current System Architecture**

### **Working Components (‚úÖ Production Ready)**

## üé® **PM33 Coding Standards & UI Design Principles**

### **üìù Code Quality Standards**

#### **IMPORTANT:**
- **Always prioritize writing clean, simple, and modular code**
- **Use simple & easy-to-understand language. Write in short sentences**
- **Don't be lazy! Always read files in full**

#### **üí¨ COMMENTS**
- **Write lots of comments in your code.** Explain exactly what you are doing in your comments
- **Be strategic:** Do not explain obvious syntax - instead explain your thought process at the time of writing the code!
- **NEVER delete explanatory comments** from the code you're editing (unless they are wrong/obsolete)
- **Focus on explaining the non-obvious stuff** in the comments, the nuances/details
- **DO NOT delete comments currently in our code.** If the comment is obsolete or wrong, then update it - but NEVER mindlessly remove comments without reason

#### **üìÑ HEADER COMMENTS**
**EVERY file HAS TO start with 4 lines of comments:**
1. **Exact file location in codebase**
2. **Clear description of what this file does**
3. **Clear description of WHY this file exists**  
4. **RELEVANT FILES:** comma-separated list of 2-4 most relevant files

**NEVER delete these "header comments" from the files you're editing.**

### **üéØ UI Design Principles**

#### **üé® Design System**
- **Minimalist UI** with clean, simple layouts and ample spacing
- **Consistent text hierarchy** with proper contrast ratios
- **Card-based layout** with subtle borders and clean separation
- **Responsive design** that adapts from mobile to desktop
- **Interactive elements** have clear hover states and transitions

#### **üé® Color Usage Rules**
- **DO NOT use colors like** `'text-gray-XXX'` or `'bg-gray-XXX'`
- **INSTEAD, use** `'neutral-XXX'` for consistency!
- **Always use design system tokens** from APP_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md and MARKETING_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md

#### **üì± Responsive Design**
- **Responsive desktop-first design.** Always think of how the UI will look on mobile
- **ALSO ensure our UI works on tablet/iPad size**

## üß™ **Testing & Quality Assurance**

### **Current Testing Setup**
- **Playwright**: Comprehensive link testing and UI validation
- **Test Results**: All core pages return HTTP 200 status
- **Design System**: Mantine UI compliance with PM33 theme
- **Responsive Design**: Desktop, tablet, mobile viewports

### **Quality Standards**
- **Professional UI**: Enterprise-grade Mantine components
- **PM33 Branding**: Logo integration and consistent visual identity
- **Performance**: Fast page loads, efficient component rendering
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance standards

## üö® **Critical Context for Agents**

### **Vision Accuracy**
- **ALWAYS use**: "PMO Transformation Platform" + "$100K MRR by EOY 2025"
- **NEVER revert to**: "Ultimate Product Agent" + "$300K MRR" (user corrected these)

### **Technical Constraints**
- **USE**: API token authentication (proven reliable)
- **AVOID**: OAuth complexity (proven to fail)
- **USE**: Mantine UI components (current standard)
- **AVOID**: Material-UI or other frameworks (creates inconsistency)

### **Development Focus**
- **Primary**: Agentic AI teams providing PMO functionality
- **Secondary**: Service integration and multi-AI orchestration
- **Avoid**: Over-engineering Jira integration vs. AI team development

### **Service Dependencies**
- All 8 services required for full PMO transformation capability
- AI teams map directly to service combinations
- Revenue model tied to service utilization and PMO value delivery
