```
Hi [Name],

I noticed you're a Senior PM at [Company] - I imagine you face complex strategic decisions daily that could benefit from expert guidance.

Most PMs spend limited strategic resources on strategic consultants for decisions like:
- "Should we pivot our roadmap based on competitive moves?"
- "How do we allocate limited resources across initiatives?"

I've built PM33 - an AI Strategic Co-Pilot that provides instant strategic guidance and automatically converts it into executable workflows.

Beta access is free - looking for 50 experienced PMs to test it before launch.

Interested in 15 minutes to see how it works?

Best,
[Your name]
```

**Personalization for each message:**
- Line 1: Mention their company specifically
- Add any recent company news, product launches, or shared connections
- Keep the rest of the template

### Step 4: Execute Outreach (2 hours)

#### Day 1 Target: 20 LinkedIn Messages
**Process:**
1. Find prospect on LinkedIn
2. Add to tracking spreadsheet
3. Send personalized connection request OR direct message
4. Move to next prospect
5. Track everything in spreadsheet

**Schedule:**
- **Morning:** 10 messages (1 hour)
- **Afternoon:** 10 messages (1 hour)

#### Message Strategy:
- **Connection Request:** "Hi [Name], fellow PM here. I'd love to connect and share something that might help with strategic product decisions."
