# Development Testing Guide - PM33 Strategic AI Co-Pilot

## 🎯 Testing Philosophy

**Goal:** Ensure Strategic AI provides high-quality, context-aware strategic guidance consistently during rapid development cycles.

**Key Principle:** Test both technical functionality AND strategic advice quality.

## 📋 Testing Levels

### 1. **Unit Testing** (Component Level)
**What:** Individual functions and API endpoints
**When:** Every code change
**Tools:** pytest, unittest

### 2. **Integration Testing** (System Level)  
**What:** Strategic AI + Context Manager + Database
**When:** Daily during development
**Tools:** Custom test scripts

### 3. **Strategic Quality Testing** (Business Level)
**What:** Quality and relevance of strategic advice
**When:** Before each feature release
**Tools:** Test scenarios + human evaluation

### 4. **User Acceptance Testing** (Product Level)
**What:** Real user workflows and scenarios
**When:** Weekly during beta phase
**Tools:** Beta user feedback + usage analytics

## 🔧 Technical Testing Setup

### Quick API Testing (30 seconds)
```bash
# Test basic API health
curl http://127.0.0.1:8001/health

# Test strategic chat with simple query
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/strategic/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Quick test question", "context": {"company_name": "PM33"}}'
```

### Interactive Testing Script
```bash
# Use the interactive tester we built
python3 ask-strategic-ai.py
```

### Automated Test Suite
```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite (to be built)
python3 test-strategic-ai.py
```

## 🎯 Strategic Quality Testing

### Test Scenario Categories

#### **1. Competitive Response Scenarios**
- "Competitor X launched feature Y. How should we respond?"
- "New well-funded startup entered our market. Strategy?"
- "Major competitor dropped prices 50%. What do we do?"

#### **2. Resource Allocation Decisions** 
- "Hire 2 engineers vs $50k marketing spend?"
- "Focus on new features vs fixing technical debt?"
- "Should we pivot our roadmap based on user feedback?"

#### **3. Go-to-Market Strategy**
- "How do we convert beta users to paid plans?"
- "Should we expand to enterprise customers?"
- "What's our pricing strategy for next quarter?"

#### **4. Crisis Management**
- "Major customer churned. How do we prevent more?"
- "Security incident affected user trust. Response plan?"
- "Key team member leaving. How do we handle transition?"

### Strategic Response Quality Criteria

#### **Context Awareness (Critical)**
- ✅ Mentions PM33-specific details (current priorities, stage, constraints)
- ✅ References our ICP (Senior PMs at Series A-C startups)
- ✅ Considers our competitive position vs. Productboard/Aha!
- ✅ Accounts for our current resources and timeline

#### **Strategic Depth (High)**
- ✅ Provides strategic frameworks, not just tactics
- ✅ Considers multiple options with trade-offs
- ✅ Addresses both short-term and long-term implications
- ✅ Connects decision to business outcomes

#### **Actionability (High)**
- ✅ Generates specific, executable tasks
- ✅ Assigns realistic roles and timelines
- ✅ Includes success metrics and tracking
- ✅ Provides implementation guidance

## 🛠️ Development Testing Workflow

### Daily Development Testing (5 minutes)
1. **API Health Check:** Ensure all endpoints respond
2. **Context Loading:** Verify context files load correctly
3. **Quick Strategic Query:** Test one scenario from each category
4. **Response Quality Check:** Verify context awareness in response

### Weekly Integration Testing (30 minutes)
1. **Full Test Suite:** Run all automated tests
2. **Strategic Scenario Testing:** Test 10 comprehensive scenarios
3. **Context Update Testing:** Update context, verify AI adapts
4. **Performance Testing:** Response times, API stability

### Pre-Release Testing (2 hours)
1. **Comprehensive Strategic Testing:** All scenario categories
2. **Edge Case Testing:** Invalid inputs, API failures
3. **User Journey Testing:** Full onboarding → strategic query → workflow
4. **Beta User Simulation:** Test from actual user perspective

## 📊 Testing Tools & Scripts

### 1. Automated Test Runner
```python
# test-strategic-ai.py
import requests
import json
from datetime import datetime

class StrategicAITester:
    def __init__(self):
        self.api_base = "http://127.0.0.1:8001"
        self.test_results = []
    
    def run_all_tests(self):
        print("🎯 PM33 Strategic AI Testing Suite")
        
        # Technical tests
        self.test_api_health()
        self.test_context_loading()
        
        # Strategic quality tests
        self.test_competitive_scenarios()
        self.test_resource_allocation()
        self.test_context_awareness()
        
        # Generate report
        self.generate_test_report()
```

### 2. Strategic Scenario Database
```json
{
  "competitive_scenarios": [
    {
      "query": "Productboard just announced AI-powered strategic planning. Should we pivot our positioning?",
      "expected_context": ["competitive_advantages", "current_priorities", "product_strategy"],
      "quality_checks": ["mentions_pm33_differentiation", "considers_timeline", "provides_specific_actions"]
    }
  ],
  "resource_allocation": [...],
  "crisis_management": [...]
}
```

### 3. Context Validation Tool
```python
# Ensures context files are complete and up-to-date
def validate_context_health():
    context_manager = StrategicContextManager()
    health = context_manager.get_context_summary()
    
    # Check completeness
    if health['context_health']['completeness_score'] < 0.8:
        print("⚠️  Context incomplete - update missing files")
    
    # Check freshness  
    if health['context_health']['stale_contexts']:
        print(f"⚠️  Stale context: {health['context_health']['stale_contexts']}")
```
