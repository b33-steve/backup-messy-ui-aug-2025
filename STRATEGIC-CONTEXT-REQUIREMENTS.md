- **Market Dynamics:** Industry trends, regulatory changes

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Requirements

### Context Storage System

## 🎯 Strategic AI Enhancement Plan

### Phase 1: Context Foundation (Day 3)
- Create context file templates
- Build context ingestion system  
- Implement basic context injection

### Phase 2: Context Intelligence (Week 2)
- Add semantic search for context retrieval
- Build context relevance scoring
- Implement context summarization

### Phase 3: Context Optimization (Week 3)
- Add context validation and completeness checks
- Build context update workflows
- Implement context-driven strategy personalization

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Context Quality
- **Completeness:** % of context categories filled out
- **Freshness:** Days since context was last updated
- **Relevance:** How often context is used in strategic responses

### Strategic Quality  
- **Specificity:** Strategic advice includes company-specific details
- **Actionability:** Recommendations account for actual resources/constraints
- **Accuracy:** Strategic advice aligns with company's real situation

## 🚀 Integration with Current MVP

The current Strategic AI Co-Pilot will be enhanced to:

1. **Load Context:** Read company context on startup
2. **Match Context:** Identify relevant context for each strategic query
3. **Inject Context:** Include relevant context in LLM prompts
4. **Track Usage:** Monitor which context drives best strategic outcomes

This transforms the Strategic AI from generic consultant to **company-specific strategic advisor** that knows your business inside and out.

## ⚡ Immediate Next Steps

1. Create context file templates for PM33
2. Build context loading system into strategic workflow engine
3. Implement context injection in strategic chat API
4. Test with PM33-specific strategic scenarios

**This context system is what will differentiate PM33 from generic AI tools and deliver the true "limited strategic capabilities replacement" value proposition.**
