## üö® Core Pain Points We Solve

### 1. **Strategy-to-Backlog Gap**
**Pain**: PMs lack automated bridges from strategy to backlog/sprints
- Strategic decisions don't automatically flow into executable work
- Manual translation from strategic insights to Jira tasks
- Context loss between strategic planning and sprint execution
- Misalignment between strategic priorities and daily work

### 2. **Stale Business Priorities**  
**Pain**: Backlogs don't reflect latest business priorities
- Business priorities change but backlogs remain static
- Manual backlog grooming can't keep pace with strategic shifts
- Teams work on outdated priorities while new opportunities emerge
- Resource allocation stuck on yesterday's strategy

### 3. **Manual Roadmap Hell**
**Pain**: Roadmap alignment and prioritization are manual and error-prone
- ICE/RICE scoring done in spreadsheets with human error
- Roadmap changes require manual cascade updates
- No automated impact analysis for priority changes
- Stakeholder alignment requires constant manual communication

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Implementation**

### **Core Data Flow**
```
Strategic Context ‚Üí AI Analysis ‚Üí Priority Scoring ‚Üí Backlog Sync ‚Üí Execution Tracking
```

### **Key Automation Points**
1. **Strategy Input** ‚Üí Automatic framework application (ICE/RICE/Blue Ocean)
2. **Priority Changes** ‚Üí Automated backlog reordering with impact analysis
3. **Strategic Decisions** ‚Üí Task generation with preserved strategic context
4. **Market Changes** ‚Üí Priority recommendations with business justification
5. **Execution Progress** ‚Üí Strategic alignment scoring and optimization

### **Integration Architecture**
- **Jira API** for bidirectional sync with strategic context
