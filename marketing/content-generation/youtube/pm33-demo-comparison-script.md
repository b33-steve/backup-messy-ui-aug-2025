## HOOK (0:00-0:15)

**[Visual: Split screen showing frustrated PM vs empowered PM with AI]**

**Narrator (energetic):** "If you're a product manager spending 60-80% of your time writing PRDs, synthesizing feedback, and creating status reports instead of building strategy, this 10-minute demo will change everything."

**[Visual: PM33 logo animation]**

"I'm going to show you PM33 - the AI tool that makes your existing PM stack 10x smarter without forcing you to migrate anything. And by the end, you'll see exactly why 2,500+ product teams chose enhancement over replacement."

**[Visual: Quick montage of PM33 in action]**

"Let's dive in."

## PROBLEM SETUP (0:15-1:30)

**[Visual: Typical PM desktop with multiple tools open - Jira, Slack, Sheets, etc.]**

**Narrator:** "Here's what most PM workflows look like: Data scattered across Jira, Slack, Monday.com, Google Sheets, Zendesk, and five other tools. Sound familiar?"

**[Visual: Time-lapse simulation of PM switching between tools]**

"You're constantly switching between tools, manually copying data, and trying to piece together insights from fragments of information. A simple feature prioritization decision requires:"

**[Visual: Checklist appearing with each item]**
- "Reviewing 200+ customer feedback messages"
- "Analyzing sprint velocity across three different dashboards" 
- "Manually writing user stories and acceptance criteria"
- "Creating executive summaries from scratch"
- "Updating stakeholders across multiple channels"

**[Visual: Clock showing time elapsed - 4 hours]**

"Four hours later, you've made one prioritization decision. Meanwhile, your competitors with AI-enhanced workflows made 10."

**[Visual: Competitor progress bar racing ahead]**

"The traditional solutions? Replace everything with a 'comprehensive' platform, spend 3-6 months migrating, retrain your entire team, and hope the new tool is actually better than what you had."

**[Visual: Migration timeline showing months of disruption]**

"There's a better way."

## SOLUTION INTRODUCTION (1:30-2:45)

**[Visual: PM33 interface appearing like an AI overlay on existing tools]**

**Narrator:** "Meet PM33. Instead of replacing your PM tools, it makes them AI-powered. Think of it as an AI brain that connects to everything you're already using."

**[Visual: Connection lines showing PM33 linking to Jira, Slack, Monday, etc.]**

"Here's what makes PM33 different from every other AI PM tool:"

**[Visual: Three-column comparison: Replace, Add-on, Enhance]**

"While other tools make you choose between replacing your entire workflow or getting basic AI features, PM33 gives you strategic AI intelligence that works with your existing stack."

**[Visual: PM33 dashboard with insights from multiple tools]**

"You keep using Jira, Monday.com, Asana, Slack - whatever works for your team. But now they're connected by an AI that thinks like a senior product manager."

**[Visual: Before/after split screen of same workflow]**

"Let me show you exactly what this looks like."

## LIVE DEMO SECTION 1: CROSS-PLATFORM INTELLIGENCE (2:45-4:30)

**[Visual: Screen recording of PM33 interface]**

**Narrator:** "This is PM33's main dashboard. Notice it's not trying to be another project management tool. Instead, it's synthesizing data from everywhere."

**[Visual: Data flowing in from different connected tools]**

"Here's the magic: PM33 has analyzed 847 Jira tickets, 23 customer interviews from Slack, 156 support tickets from Zendesk, and our latest user research. Instead of me spending hours connecting these dots manually..."

**[Visual: AI analysis happening in real-time]**

"PM33's AI immediately identifies that mobile performance issues are mentioned in 34% of support tickets, correlate with a 23% increase in churn, and appear in sprint retrospectives as a recurring blocker."

**[Visual: Insight appearing with supporting data points]**

"But here's the strategic part - it doesn't just tell me what's happening. It tells me what to do about it."

**[Visual: AI recommendation panel opening]**

"'Based on historical data, prioritizing mobile performance optimization would reduce churn by an estimated 34% and increase customer satisfaction by 0.8 points. Recommended timeline: 2 sprints. Here are the specific technical requirements and user stories to get started.'"

**[Visual: Generated PRD and user stories]**

"This insight would have taken me 4-6 hours to compile manually. PM33 generated it in 30 seconds, and it's more comprehensive than what I would have created on my own."

---

## LIVE DEMO SECTION 2: AUTOMATED DOCUMENTATION (4:30-6:00)

**[Visual: New feature request coming in through Slack]**

**Narrator:** "Let's see document generation in action. Here's a feature request that just came in: 'Users want better onboarding flow - current drop-off is too high.'"

**[Visual: Typing the brief description into PM33]**

"Instead of spending 3-4 hours writing a comprehensive PRD, watch this."

**[Visual: AI generating complete documentation in real-time]**

"PM33 is creating:"
- "Complete PRD with problem statement, user personas, and success metrics"
- "Epic breakdown with 8 user stories and acceptance criteria" 
- "Technical requirements based on our existing architecture"
- "Testing scenarios including edge cases"
- "Implementation timeline with dependencies"

**[Visual: Document appearing fully formatted]**

"Five minutes. That's what used to take me half a day, and it's formatted exactly how our team expects. But the AI doesn't just generate generic content - it's learned our team's patterns, terminology, and standards."

**[Visual: Highlighting team-specific elements in the generated content]**

"Notice it referenced our specific onboarding metrics, used our standard user story format, and even included our accessibility requirements without me asking."

**[Visual: Side-by-side comparison with manually written PRD]**

"This isn't replacing human thinking - it's handling the routine work so I can focus on the strategic decisions."

## COMPETITOR COMPARISON (6:00-7:15)

**[Visual: Comparison table appearing]**

**Narrator:** "Now, let's address the elephant in the room. How does this compare to other AI PM tools?"

**[Visual: Screenshots of ChatPRD, Productboard AI, ClickUp AI]**

"ChatPRD excels at document generation but requires you to manage everything else manually. Productboard AI has great customer feedback features but costs $25-74 per user and requires full migration. ClickUp AI gives you project management plus AI, but you're starting from scratch."

**[Visual: Migration timeline comparison]**

"Here's the reality check: ChatPRD takes 2-4 weeks to implement effectively. Productboard migration typically takes 4-8 weeks. ClickUp setup ranges from 2-6 weeks depending on complexity."

**[Visual: PM33 setup animation]**

"PM33? You're productive in hours. Because you're not changing your workflow - you're supercharging it."

**[Visual: Cost comparison chart]**

"Cost-wise, PM33's usage-based pricing means you pay for value, not seats. A 10-person team using PM33 Professional costs $3,600 annually versus $6,000-8,800 for Productboard or $2,000-3,000 for ClickUp plus AI add-ons."

**[Visual: ROI calculation]**

"But here's what matters: PM33 customers report 60-80% time savings on routine work. For our 10-person team example, that's equivalent to gaining 6-8 additional PMs worth of strategic capacity."

## CUSTOMER SUCCESS STORY (7:15-8:00)

**[Visual: Customer testimonial text overlay with company logos]**

**Narrator:** "Don't just take my word for it. Sarah Chen, Head of Product at TechFlow, told us:"

**[Visual: Quote animation]**

"'PM33's AI handles all our routine documentation and analysis. Our PMs now spend 3x more time on customer research and strategic planning. We shipped 40% more features without hiring additional PMs. Game-changer for our product velocity.'"

**[Visual: Before/after metrics for TechFlow]**

"TechFlow saw results in their first month: 68% time savings on routine work, 42% increase in feature velocity, and ROI payback in just 3 weeks."

**[Visual: Multiple customer logos and metrics]**

"This isn't a one-off result. Across 2,500+ teams using PM33, the average impact is 60-80% time savings and 40%+ increase in strategic output."
