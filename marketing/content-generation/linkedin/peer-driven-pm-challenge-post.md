# LinkedIn Post: Peer-Driven PM Challenge

## Post Title: What's Your Favorite Way to Keep Product Roadmaps Actually Collaborative?

## Opening Hook
"I'm curious—what's your favorite way to keep your product roadmap collaborative instead of just another deck that collects dust?"

## Invite Stories and Debate
"Let's swap tactics—here's what our PM circle shared last week:

→ Some swear by live roadmap reviews with rotating stakeholder leads
→ Others do async voting on feature priorities using simple polls  
→ A few have moved to 'roadmap office hours' where anyone can drop in with questions"

## Share Real Peer Examples
"My favorite so far came from @SarahPM at a Series B startup: 'We treat our roadmap like a Wikipedia page—anyone can suggest edits, but changes require peer review from 2+ PMs plus engineering lead approval.'"

"Poll I ran in our PM Slack: 
- 40% use live collaborative sessions
- 35% prefer async feedback loops  
- 25% mix both approaches
- Surprising: Only 60% actually measure if their 'collaborative' process works!"

## Build Conversation, Not Conversion
"Reply with a challenge you're facing with roadmap collaboration—I'm thinking about facilitating a small group discussion for PMs dealing with similar stakeholder dynamics."

## Value-First Table (Community-Sourced)
| Community-Sourced Approach | Best For | Pro Tip |
|----------------------------|----------|---------|
| Quarterly roadmap hackathons | Distributed teams | Start with async prep, end with live voting |
| Weekly roadmap office hours | Stakeholder-heavy orgs | Rotate facilitator each session |
| Living roadmap wiki | Fast-moving startups | Version control + comment threads |
| Feature request triage calls | Customer-driven products | Include support team insights |

## Include Open Invitation
"If you'd like to co-author a collaborative roadmapping resource or host a local PM conversation about stakeholder alignment, drop a comment or DM! Always looking for peers who want to figure this stuff out together."

**Tag active community contributors:**
"Tagging @ProductAlly @PMInsights @CollaborativePM—you've all shared great roadmap tactics before. What's working for your teams lately?"

## Best Practices Implementation:

**Community-First Elements:**
- Opens with genuine curiosity, not expertise claim
- Shares peer examples with attribution
- Includes poll data from community input
- Offers to facilitate peer discussions
- Tags people known for community building

**Authentic Voice:**
- "I'm curious" instead of "I know"
- "Let's swap tactics" instead of "Here's how to do it"
- "Favorite so far" shows ongoing learning
- "Figure this stuff out together" positions as peer, not expert

**PM33 Integration (Subtle):**
- No direct PM33 mention in this post
- If commenters ask about tools, include PM33 in broader list
- Focus on collaboration patterns, not specific platform features
- Share insights about what makes collaboration work

**Engagement Strategy:**
- Ask for specific challenges, not general thoughts
- Offer concrete next steps (group discussion)
- Create space for peer-to-peer connection
- Invite co-creation, not consumption

**Follow-up Plan:**
- Respond authentically to every comment
- Share follow-up resources based on discussion themes
- Connect people with similar challenges privately  
- Create recurring monthly "roadmap collaboration check-ins"
