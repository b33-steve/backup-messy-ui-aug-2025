Here's the thing most PMs miss about AI:

It's not about replacing human judgment.
It's about eliminating the busywork so you can focus on:

â†’ Strategic thinking
â†’ Customer empathy  
â†’ Team leadership
â†’ Creative problem-solving

The human skills that actually matter.

The teams already using AI for PM work report:

âœ… 60-80% time savings on routine tasks
âœ… 40% more features shipped without hiring
âœ… 3x more time for customer research  
âœ… ROI positive within first month

While others are still manually writing user stories.

But here's the biggest mistake I see:

PMs trying to use general AI tools (ChatGPT) for PM-specific work.

You need AI that:
â†’ Integrates with your PM tools
â†’ Understands product management context
â†’ Learns your team's patterns
â†’ Provides strategic insights, not just task automation
