# Reddit Post: r/ProductManagement - Crowdsourcing AI PM Workflows

## Title: Let's Crowdsource Solutions: How Are You Actually Using AI in Your PM Work? (All Approaches Welcome)

## TL;DR
Looking for real PM workflows or tool combinations that help with AI integration. All approaches welcome‚Äîsophisticated AI tools, simple automation, or even "tried AI, went back to spreadsheets."

## Personal Story/Problem Statement
I've been experimenting with AI in my PM workflow for 6 months. Started with ChatGPT for PRD drafts, moved to specialized tools, now trying to figure out what actually saves time vs. what feels cool but doesn't move the needle.

**My honest assessment so far:**
- ‚úÖ AI for first-draft documents: Massive time saver
- ‚ùå AI for customer interview analysis: Still prefer manual synthesis  
- ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è AI for prioritization: Helpful but not revolutionary
- ‚úÖ AI for stakeholder communication: Game-changer for exec summaries

## Invite Candid Community Input
I'm stuck on where to invest more AI learning time vs. where to stick with proven manual processes. What's actually worked for you?

**Specifically curious about:**
- Which AI tools integrated well with your existing workflow vs. created more work
- Any "simple" solutions that outperformed fancy AI platforms
- Workflows where you tried AI but went back to manual approaches
- Team adoption challenges and what actually helped

## Community-Shared Tactics (Will Update as Thread Grows)

**From u/PMAtStartup:**
"Tried 5 different AI PM tools. Ended up with ChatGPT + Notion + good old user interview spreadsheets. Sometimes the boring stuff just works."

**From u/B2BProductLead:**  
"AI for documentation, humans for customer insights. Period. Spent 3 months trying to get AI to understand user research nuance‚Äînot worth it."

**From u/EnterprisePI:**
"Team uses PM33 for cross-platform insights, Productboard for roadmaps, and weekly human sync for anything requiring judgment. Hybrid approach works."

**From u/SeriesBPM:**
"Voice memos ‚Üí AI transcription ‚Üí manual synthesis. Best of both worlds for capturing ideas on the go."

## Give Back
I'll package all approaches into a free, open-access doc organized by:
- Tool combinations that work
- Workflows where manual beats AI  
- Team adoption strategies
- Cost/benefit reality checks

## Encourage Ongoing Dialogue
