### Template 1: Cold Outreach to Senior PMs
**Subject:** "Strategic AI Co-Pilot for Product Managers (Beta Access)"

Hi [Name],

I noticed you're a Senior PM at [Company] - I imagine you face complex strategic decisions daily that could benefit from expert guidance.

Most PMs struggle with strategic decisions that directly impact revenue growth:
- "Should we pivot our roadmap based on competitive moves?"
- "How do we allocate limited resources across initiatives?" 
- "What's our response to market changes?"

I've built PM33 - agentic AI teams that transform PMs into fully functional PMOs, driving product-led growth through strategic automation, improved execution alignment, and intelligent backlog management.

**Beta access is free** - I'm looking for 50 experienced PMs to test it before our official launch.

Interested in 15 minutes to see how it works? You can ask it any strategic PM question and see the AI generate actionable workflows.

Best,
[Your name]
PM33 Founder

### Template 2: LinkedIn Outreach
**Subject:** "Quick strategic PM question"

Hi [Name],

Fellow PM here - quick question: when you need strategic guidance on major product decisions, where do you typically turn? 

I've been working on solving this exact problem and would love 2 minutes of your time to show you something that might be helpful.

Built an AI Strategic Co-Pilot specifically for PMs that turns strategic questions into executable workflows. Currently in beta.

Worth a quick look?

### LinkedIn Post 2: Problem/Solution
💰 **Product Managers: Transform into PMOs with Agentic AI Teams**

Here's what I learned after interviewing 100+ Senior PMs:

**The Pain:**
- Strategic decisions take weeks (consultant availability)
- Limited strategic capabilities without PMO-level resources
- Generic advice that doesn't account for your specific context
- No automatic conversion to actionable tasks

**The Reality:**
Most strategic PM questions follow similar patterns. The expertise exists - it just needs to be accessible, instant, and tailored to your company's context.

**Our Approach:**
AI Strategic Co-Pilot that knows your company context, competitive landscape, and resource constraints.

Ask: "Should we build feature X or focus on retention?"
Get: Strategic analysis + executable 5-task workflow with priorities and timelines.

**Currently in Beta** - looking for Senior PMs to test with real strategic challenges.

Who else sees this problem? 🤔
