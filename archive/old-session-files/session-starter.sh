We're working on PM33 PMO Transformation with Agentic AI Teams - transforming PMs into PMOs with fully functional agentic AI teams.

CURRENT STATUS:
- Project: PM33 PMO Transformation (Services-based SAAS with agentic AI teams)
- Goal: $100K MRR by Dec 31, 2025 (20-week execution plan)
- Focus: Building agentic AI teams that provide PMO-level capabilities
- Architecture: FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Multi-AI (Claude, OpenAI, Together)
- Foundation: Proven API sync + intelligent mapping patterns from Replit solution

TECHNICAL STATUS:
- Location: /Users/ssaper/Desktop/my-projects/pm33-claude-execution
- Database: Railway PostgreSQL connected  
- API Keys: All configured (Anthropic, Resend, PostHog, Pinecone)
- Dependencies: Python packages installed
- Environment: .env file configured with all keys

KEY CONTEXT FILES (read these for full context):
1. /strategy/execution-plan/pm33-strategic-recommendations.md (main strategy)
2. /actions/week-1-execution-commands.md (detailed commands)  
3. /strategy/competitive-analysis/market-research-key-findings.md (market research)
4. /actions/daily-tasks-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md (today's specific tasks)

IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:
1. Check today's tasks: python3 actions/daily-agent.py generate
2. Execute Day 2 commands: Strategic AI Chat API + React component
3. Focus: Build core differentiator (AI chat with workflow generation)

VALUE PROP: "PMO-level capabilities at PM budget through agentic AI teams"
DIFFERENTIATOR: Transforms individual PMs into fully functional PMOs with AI-powered strategic teams

Ready to continue execution!
